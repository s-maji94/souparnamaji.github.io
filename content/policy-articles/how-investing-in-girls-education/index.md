abstract: |-
  Recent global statistics indicate that approximately 27% of women have faced physical or sexual violence from a current or former male partner at least once (World Health Organization (WHO), 2021). This disturbing trend is mirrored in India, where nearly one-third of women between the ages of 15 and 49 report experiencing domestic violence (International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS) and ICF, 2020). Domestic violence has a damaging personal impact and creates significant barriers to women's independence in both private and public spheres (Rana et al. 2023). It impairs women's health, educational outcomes, and economic potential, ultimately restricting the development of society's human capital (Aizer 2011, Campbell 2002, Huth-Bocks et al. 2001, Koenen et al. 2003).  
  
  In line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, there is an urgent need to recognise the widespread harm and violation of human rights, and eradicate violence against women and girls. In this context, in Agarwal et al. (2024), we investigate the long-term impact of education reforms targeted towards girls of school-going age on domestic violence later in their adulthood.
